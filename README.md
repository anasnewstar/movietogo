## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Replace placeholder images with actual images (see images/placeholder.txt for details)
3. Open index.html in your web browser to view the website

## How It Works

The website demonstrates how to:
- Create a responsive movie streaming website
- Implement a slider for featured content
- Create movie cards with hover effects
- Build a movie player that can embed external sources
- Implement search functionality
- Organize movies by categories

For actual production use, you would need to:
1. Connect to a real API for movie data
2. Set up a backend for user accounts, comments, etc.
3. Implement actual embedding logic for external sources
4. Add proper error handling for API requests

## Browser Compatibility

The website is designed to work on modern browsers, including:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
